				<h2>Welcome to Sweetums</h2>
				<p>When the Sweetums company was founded by Nick Newport, Sr., its primary purpose was to use corn syrup to fatten cows, which would later be killed. Since then, Sweetums has focused on using corn syrup to create candy products that appeal to people of all ages, under the ownership of Nick Newport, Jr. Sweetums has become a family-friendly company that is devoted to their consumers as they strive to treat them like family that can meet their desires no matter where they are.</p>
