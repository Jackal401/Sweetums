				<h2>Sweets by Sweetums</h2>
				<p>Welcome to our Sweets section which includes some of the products we make at Sweetums. Among the ingredients we use to create our sweets, corn syrup is the key ingredient that drives their successes. Corn syrup is natural and healthy as it comes from corn, and offers the same vitamins and fiber. Feel free to try any of these products, and experience a greater burst of energy and sweetness than what sugar alone can provide.</p>
